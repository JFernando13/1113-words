We all have problems that we are afraid to solve; we all have a past we don't want to remember. I could see it in the stories my cousins told me, the confessions they made, and the attitude they had when revealing their struggles, all clearly indicating a reluctance to take the next step.

Yes, it's scary to change the course of our lives, to leave things behind and transform our lives into something that might be better. It's the fear of uncertainty that prevents us from addressing the problems we face, but we must do it regardless of what feelings or statistics say because, whether it turns out well or not, you always gain an experience that you can share with others who will pass through your place.

In my case, it's not difficult for me to let go and accept what has already happened. Although I often regret past situations, I know how to accept them and move forward because I can't linger on something that has already occurred. I can't keep hoping to fix the mistakes I made with Laura; I have to find solutions to improve our current situation, which isn't great, but with what I'm learning, I'm sure we'll fix it.

Today, after a long time, I also had the opportunity to socialize with people my age who weren't Laura. I could see another reality and feel comfortable in it, once again realizing that living without Laura is not madness. I can live quite well without her, but it's not the same when she is present; life is very different.

Her environment, her context, push her to lead a more glamorous, elegant, and organized life. The life she leads forces her to mature faster than others of her age, to stay one step ahead if she doesn't want to drown in the difficult situations life presents because, from a young age, she was repressed. She experienced bullying in school due to her body, affecting her self-esteem, and had to take medication for a while because the anxiety and fear were so overwhelming that they didn't let her live peacefully.

It's admirable how she managed to overcome and ground herself to raise her voice, refusing to be insulted by anyone or anything. Fortunately, she can now say that this problem has been overcome, and she can take photos and show them to the world. She loves dressing up and looking good, though she doesn't use many extravagant accessories. Undoubtedly, she knows how to dress quite elegantly. She is a great example of the beauty in simplicity. Just by looking at her, you can see how precious and delicate, subtle and radiant she is; there's no one who matches what her being radiates.

She appears to be a simple person, an ordinary person like anyone else. However, just by talking to her a few times, you can realize all the beauty and wonder she hides. I have nothing but admiration for her, for everything she has done and achieved. I have no doubt that achieving the happiness she shows to everyone she's with hasn't been easy. I have no doubt that it's not easy being in her place, dealing with love, self-esteem, and the motivation to move forward.

I am extremely happy for her and everything that has happened to her. She is a very strong woman, and she will continue to demonstrate that with the things that lie ahead. She knows how to deal with problems, and she always has someone like me who loves her so much and gives her everything she deserves.

There is nothing more beautiful than seeing the person you love happy, regardless of whether you can be with her. You rejoice simply because she is in the place she wants to be with that beautiful characteristic smile. That image in your head stirs so many beautiful emotions within you that it's inevitable not to feel happy and draw a beautiful smile on your face.

Laura produces that beautiful feeling in me every time I think of her, every time I realize the immense love I have for her and how incredible she is. Because with or without me, I know she will be phenomenal; she won't lack anything, and what she lacks, I am sure she can achieve on her own.

How beautiful love is when it is given the freedom for the person to have the life they want and to see them so happy in that place. Love is so beautiful when it is understood that to love, you don't need the person to be there. Having an understanding of what she is, just that is more than enough to keep loving her for the rest of your life.

I hope things improve greatly with her, that we can fix the problems, that there is no longer that discord we have, that words flow like the day we first met, that there is no discomfort I often feel about saying something that might damage what we have.

Love can transform your entire life completely. With the simple act of loving, at least you maintain a smile that you cannot erase. But if you add to love the act of sharing and blending life with that person you love... I can't describe the feeling that moment brings. There is a shortage of letters in the alphabet to form the words that describe that feeling, which I wouldn't change even if I were brought back from the dead.

If I could give you advice, I would say feel every emotion and enjoy every moment, especially when you share life with someone else. Those days that pass feel like moments in time that somehow we have to preserve in our bodies because we don't know when we'll have to say goodbye to that person we love. And from experience, I can tell you it's not something that brings a smile to your face.

So, enjoy those beautiful moments, enjoy the bad and the good times. Learn to accept that there are many things you won't be able to control, but don't be discouraged and take those things you can control as far as no one can reach you.
