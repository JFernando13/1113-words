Tranquility is that emotion that helps us find happiness to enjoy the moments we are living. Tranquility is not given by the moment you are experiencing, but by the willingness you have and the person you are sharing it with, because even if your life is in a storm, with the right person everything is like a calm sea, much quieter and more pleasant.

People will come into your life, some of whom will give you more or less of that sensation, but you should always try to keep the people who bring you that calmness and peace that your life always needs, so as not to lose the happiness of enjoying the good or bad moments that happen in your life, not to miss the opportunity to make a good decision, not to lead a stressful life, etc. Calmness brings us many benefits, and we should always be with the person who can provide it to us.

In my case, that person already has a name, Laura. She is the person who gives me that peace and tranquility I need in my life. Every time I am near her, I feel like I'm in a calm sea, I feel at peace, tranquil, and without her having to do anything, with her mere presence in my life is enough for me to be calm because she radiates so much happiness that just by watching her and admiring her beauty, I can enjoy and be calm.

Very few people bring us such happiness, very few people have the ability to give you that strong feeling of tranquility with so little effort. Those people who have the ability to give you so much calmness despite so much disorder and turmoil in your life are very valuable. Laura is very valuable for emitting so much joy and tranquility with just her presence because I know that I am not the only one who can enjoy that incredible sensation that she produces, and I am very happy that more people like me can enjoy someone like her.

She is a wonderful person because she brings beauty to simplicity, exalts what does not stand out, enhances like a math problem a feeling, and completely transforms the life you are living. To me, Laura is a wonderful person, although at first glance, it may not seem like it, it is fantastic what that little person can achieve.

On days like today, where you enjoy the beach, where I have the opportunity to think, to be calm and open my heart, all those feelings come out of my mouth and turn into bursts of the immense love I feel for her, everything I live and feel becomes desires and longings for her.

Enjoying life, laughing, playing, having fun, being happy, admiring, are all actions that remind me of Laura and generate in me such a precious and pure feeling that makes me want to stay in that place forever, spend days and nights in those moments, remembering and living with so much happiness that Laura is not in my life.

If she is not in my life, but despite that, I can be happy, thanks to her, thanks to the love I have for her, thanks to what she did at that time and that I still keep, thanks to all that, I can be calm every time I think of her and desire her, thanks to her, I can be okay without her.

Without a doubt, being with her will be much better than being without her because with everything she generates, without being present, I don't want to imagine what she can do when we are together. It is impressive how one person can achieve so much in your life.

I can't explain how Laura has completely transformed my life; undoubtedly, she has improved it. The tranquility, peace, and serenity that I have in my life, I owe it to her, undoubtedly, she is to blame for how I feel because I also have some blame for transforming love into that, but without her presence, without her personality, without being her, I could never have achieved it.

I love having the ability to admire, to observe the sea and see her, to get excited about how happy she is being because I undoubtedly love that she can also be happy without me and that she has the life she wants to have, with the friends and companions she wants to have in her life because she is a wonderful person, and everyone deserves to be enchanted by her presence.

It's a shame that I can't do it, but in any case, I am very happy to have shared with her, I am calm and happy, that thanks to her, I have such beautiful days like today, that even if we don't do wonders, thanks to her memory and what she left in my life, I can enjoy it so much.

Without a doubt, there are no more words that can describe what I feel and for Laura, there are no more phrases or concepts that can describe what I feel for Laura because that feeling has transformed in a way that has risen like foam and has not stopped surprising me.

This feeling is very rare; it is not easy to find it; it is not easy to live what I am living and in the magnitudes that I am doing it. It is impressive; it is majestic, what I am living today, and I hope that the future is much better; I hope the best for her.

Days like today will always be stored in memory; days like today have a meaning beyond being a happy day; days like today are a marvel that cannot be described with words; they only have feelings and sensations that when remembered produce incredible emotions.

I hope that days like today also repeat much more, and that more moments are generated, in which Laura is my center of attention; I hope to have more moments in which I can demonstrate and express my immense love and that more people are infected with it because loving is very beautiful; it has a magic and charm like no other feeling has.

Love is one of the most beautiful things in the world; it gives you so much tranquility and so much peace; it generates a unique happiness. When it is real, it produces such an immense feeling of fullness that life becomes a wonder to live, especially sharing such beautiful moments. I hope the future is much better, and I can share it with Laura.
