In life, there are many things that excite me, but today I want to talk about adult life, where paperwork becomes the most important material, where carrying documents that validate and somehow give word to your actions. A piece of paper becomes one of the most fundamental and important tools in your life.

For everything, you will need to document your life. In this case, I need to get my driver's license, and before the state, I have to register with the RUNT, which is responsible for maintaining the information of anyone traveling on the country's roads.

To do that registration, I needed my physical ID, but this time I didn't bring it; I completely forgot, and even though I had the digital ID, it's not updated to be able to do the procedure with the digital ID, so I definitely needed the physical ID to attend my driving classes, so I had to reschedule until Friday.

The more people are part of your life, the harder it becomes to keep them in order regarding the regulations of the documents that validate your actions to some extent, because if you have a partner, you need to document your status (in case of marriage), as well as if you have children, a house, cars, businesses, etc. You need to have everything documented, and often it's difficult.

Being with Laura made that situation much easier for me, although I'm pretty good at managing order and being responsible, Laura is a person who has had to live an adult life since she was very young. At just 16, she was the one who made payments at the bank, at the registry office if her mom needed something, or even at the city hall she had to go on some occasions.

In conclusion, she is a woman with much more experience than me, since I have never had to do any of that, I don't know what it's like to pay an electricity, water, or gas bill, I don't know what it's like to pay rent or a house, I don't know what it's like to pay for something in cash, I don't know many things about adult life that would undoubtedly be much simpler and less burdensome with Laura.

Facing that life alone is scary, failing is scary, making mistakes and getting very harmed in that situation is scary, because a simple mistake can cost you a lot, and in several occasions, you can't get rid of it. So you have to be very careful when handling documents, making registrations at known or unknown places, you always have to be attentive and not be ignorant on the subject, so that we don't make mistakes at any time.

Anyway, I don't doubt that it's also complex for her, fortunately for me she has friends much older than her who help and take care of her very well, fortunately she has friends she can rely on and everything will be fine.

In case they are not here, I will be here for her, waiting for her to look for me, waiting for her to need my help, although I sincerely doubt that she will look for me at some point, even if she needs it, even if I'm the only person in the world who can help her, I'm completely sure that she will prefer to look for something else to save herself instead of asking for my help.

Unfortunately, that's how serious the situation is between her and me, unfortunately, that's how strong and tough all this is, but I always try to put on a good face, I've been trying to do that for a few weeks now, and although many times I haven't succeeded, I think I'm on the right track. In previous occasions, I would have gotten depressed and I would have been very upset for wasting time and not taking advantage of it for something else.

Fortunately, the time I lived with Laura, I was able to learn to solve those problems I had, and that behavior is not so constant in my life anymore, I can already master many of the issues and problems that I was not 100% capable of before.

I wish Laura were in my life to keep helping me, I need her in many other things, I'm not very good at being alone, unfortunately in social things, where I have to interact with many people, I'm not very good, my way of speaking is not the best which is why I always make some mistake and being with her would be easier or she could help me fix it.

Anyway, life with Laura would be much better than life without her, adult life, which I am eagerly awaiting and waiting for it to come into my life, would be much simpler if she wasn't annoyed with me at all, because if I could write to her from time to time to ask her some things, I would be very happy.

Apart from that, in my teenage life, I also have to learn many things, it's not easy to get rid of the hormonal urges that make me want to be with someone, that's one of the things I fail the most and find it hard to master. Very much hand in hand with that, I am also someone too uncontrollable and I let myself be carried away a lot by what I'm wishing at the moment.

That thought is fine, but sometimes it's better not to adopt it, since sometimes I need to focus on what's important and not follow my desires, because many times they don't do what's best for me, for example, sometimes I feel like watching YouTube all day, but I have several activities to do, at that moment I have to listen to my mind and not to my heart.

However, there are moments when I'm tired of working and I need a change, I need to free myself, so doing what I like is a very good way to satisfy that desire and besides, I'm satisfying many other desires, so everything is great.

In summary, life is not easy, in each of its stages there are inherent problems that combine with the problems of everyday life that I had saved since I was a child and where it becomes very difficult to carry out, so it is necessary to be very calm and if you can be in good company much better.

Loneliness is not very easy to cope with for many people, I hope you can handle it very well and also have someone to accompany you for a very, very, very, good time.
